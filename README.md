    #### Description: 
    
    This project is a system designed to manage and track inventory items, providing functionality for adding, updating, deleting, and generating reports on items. The core components of the system include an `InventoryItem` class, which holds details about each item such as item ID, name, quantity, price, and supplier. You can interact with the system via a menu-driven interface that allows them to view inventory statistics, update item details, delete items, or generate an inventory report. The system also supports file I/O operations, saving inventory data to a CSV file and loading it back when the program restarts. The program includes logging to keep track of actions performed within the system.

To ensure proper inventory tracking and analysis, the program offers data analysis features such as calculating the total inventory value and the average item price. It uses pandas for generating detailed reports that provide insights into the inventoryâ€™s overall value. Input validation is incorporated to ensure that only valid data is entered when adding or updating items. I created this to handle basic inventory management tasks efficiently and can be extended with more features, such as stock alerts or multi-supplier management, as needed. The system can also be tested using assertions to verify the functionality of key operations, such as adding, updating, and deleting items, making it easy to ensure the software works as intended.
